### Chapter VII A Mad Tea-Party

#### indignant
“There’s plenty of room!” said Alice _indignantly_.

If you are **indignan**, you are shocked and angry, because you think that something is unjust or unfair. The word shares the same root _digus_ with _ignition_.

#### raven
“Why is a _raven_ like a writing-desk?” 

A **raven** is a large bird with shiny black feathers and a deep harsh call. (渡鸭)

#### riddle
“I’m glad they’ve begun asking _riddles_.—I believe I can guess that,” she added aloud. 

A **riddle** is a puzzle or joke in which you ask a question that seems to be nonsense but which has a clever or amusing answer. 

#### meek
“It was the best butter,” the March Hare _meekly_ replied.

If you describe a person as **meek**, you think that they are gentle and quiet, and likely to do what other people say. 

#### gloomy
The March Hare took the watch and looked at it _gloomily_: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again

If people are **gloomy**, they are unhappy and have no hope. 

#### contemptuous
“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head _contemptuously_. “I dare say you never even spoke to Time!”

If you are **contemptuous** of someone or something, you do not like or respect them at all. 
 
#### twinkling
You'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a _twinkling_! Half-past one, time for dinner!

a very short time; instant; moment

#### pinch
Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep “Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle—” and went on so long that they had to _pinch_ it to make it stop. 

If you **pinch** a part of someone's body, you take a piece of their skin between your thumb and first finger and give it a short squeeze. 

#### feeble
“I wasn’t asleep,” he said in a hoarse, _feeble_ voice: “I heard every word you fellows were saying.” 

If you describe someone or something as **feeble**, you mean that they are weak. 

#### treacle
“They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two. 

**Treacle** is a thick, sweet, sticky liquid that is obtained when sugar is processed. It is used in making cakes and puddings. 

#### jug
as the March Hare had just upset the _milk-jug_ into his plate.

A **jug** is a cylindrical container with a handle and is used for holding and pouring liquids. 

#### shriek
but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little _shriek_

a shrill and piercing cry 尖锐刺耳的叫声

#### fountain
she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool _fountains_.

A **fountain** is an ornamental feature in a pool or lake which consists of a long narrow stream of water that is forced up into the air by a pump.
